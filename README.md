# server-status-bot
A simple (yet poorly written) Discord bot to provide information about Minecraft server status. Originally created for [Minecraft Science Kingdom](https://sciencekingdom.gg).

# Requirements
1. Python
2. ``mcstatus`` library
3. Discord bot token

# How to use
This program is not intentionally made to be used by others, but I think the program is self-explanatory. 
If you want to use this program, you can just change the value of ``javaserver``, ``bedrockserver``, and ``bot_token`` in line 8 of ``bot.py``. Also, you can change the message to anything you want.
